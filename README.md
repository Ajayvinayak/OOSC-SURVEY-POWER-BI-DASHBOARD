# OOSC Survey Dashboard - Power BI

## Project Overview
The **OOSC (Out-of-School Children) Survey Dashboard** in Power BI provides a comprehensive analysis of survey data related to children who are out of school. The dashboard visualizes critical metrics such as dropout rates, enrollment trends, age demographics, and regional differences. It aims to help stakeholders make informed decisions to address and reduce the number of out-of-school children.

## Key Features
- **Dropout Analysis**: Explore the reasons why children drop out of school, broken down by various demographics.
- **Enrollment Trends**: Visual representation of student enrollment over time, showing the progress or challenges in getting children into school.
- **Age Demographics**: Analyzes the age distribution of out-of-school children, helping identify age groups that are most at risk.
- **Regional Disparities**: Highlights areas with the highest and lowest out-of-school rates, assisting in region-specific policy-making.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by region, age, gender, or other parameters to gain customized insights.
  
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software to view and interact with the dashboard:
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop (or Power BI Service for cloud access).
- The `OOSC_SURVEY_FULL_REPORT.pbix` file (provided in the repository).

## Installation & Setup
1. Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. Clone or download the repository containing the `.pbix` file:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oosc-survey-dashboard.git
   ```
3. Open the `OOSC_SURVEY_FULL_REPORT.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
4. Explore the interactive visuals to gain insights into the out-of-school children survey.

## Dashboard Usage
- **Home Page**: Provides an overview of key statistics like total out-of-school children and enrollment progress.
- **Dropout Reasons**: Drill down into the main factors contributing to school dropouts.
- **Demographics**: Analyze data by age, gender, and other relevant factors.
- **Regional Analysis**: Focus on specific regions to understand where the issue is most pressing and track progress over time.

## Data Source
The data used in this dashboard comes from the **OOSC Survey**, collected across various regions to capture the current state of school attendance and educational accessibility.

## Future Enhancements
- **Predictive Analytics**: Incorporate machine learning models to predict dropout risks.
- **Real-time Updates**: Connect to live data sources for real-time tracking of educational programs.
- **Mobile View**: Optimize the dashboard for mobile users.
